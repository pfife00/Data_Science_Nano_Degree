# Introduction to Data Science
## Project: Write a Data Science Blog Post

### Installation

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Project Motivation

For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow data from 2018 to better understand:
  1. How many years of coding should one have in order to land a full-time job?
  2. How does one's Undergraduate Degree major contribute to landing a full-time job?
  3. Which other aspects correlate well to landing a full-time job? 

### File Descriptions

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for the individual steps.

### Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](http://www.numpy.org/).

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgments
Credit should be given to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). The code provided in the section to evaluate and plot the feature section was obtained from Udacity Data Science Nano Degree Project: Finding Donors for CharityML visuals.py helper function.
