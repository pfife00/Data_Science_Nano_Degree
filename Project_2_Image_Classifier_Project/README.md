Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

Load and preprocess the image dataset
Train the image classifier on your dataset
Use the trained classifier to predict image content
We'll lead you through each part which you'll implement in Python.

When you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with your new skills depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset. For example, imagine an app where you take a picture of a car, it tells you what the make and model is, then looks up information about it. Go build your own dataset and make something new.

Prerequisites
The Code is written in Python 3.6.7rc2. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip.

Command Line Application
Train a new network on a data set with train.py

Basic Usage : python train.py data_directory
Prints out current epoch, training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy as the network trains.

Load the data
Here you'll use torchvision to load the data (documentation). The data should be included alongside this notebook, otherwise you can download it here. The dataset is split into three parts, training, validation, and testing. For the training, you'll want to apply transformations such as random scaling, cropping, and flipping. This will help the network generalize leading to better performance. You'll also need to make sure the input data is resized to 224x224 pixels as required by the pre-trained networks.

The validation and testing sets are used to measure the model's performance on data it hasn't seen yet. For this you don't want any scaling or rotation transformations, but you'll need to resize then crop the images to the appropriate size.

The pre-trained networks you'll use were trained on the ImageNet dataset where each color channel was normalized separately. For all three sets you'll need to normalize the means and standard deviations of the images to what the network expects. For the means, it's [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and for the standard deviations [0.229, 0.224, 0.225], calculated from the ImageNet images. These values will shift each color channel to be centered at 0 and range from -1 to 1.

Label mapping
You'll also need to load in a mapping from category label to category name. You can find this in the file cat_to_name.json. It's a JSON object which you can read in with the json module. This will give you a dictionary mapping the integer encoded categories to the actual names of the flowers.


Load a pre-trained network (If you need a starting point, the VGG networks work great and are straightforward to use)
Define a new, untrained feed-forward network as a classifier, using ReLU activations and dropout
Train the classifier layers using backpropagation using the pre-trained network to get the features
Track the loss and accuracy on the validation set to determine the best hyperparameters
We've left a cell open for you below, but use as many as you need. Our advice is to break the problem up into smaller parts you can run separately. Check that each part is doing what you expect, then move on to the next. You'll likely find that as you work through each part, you'll need to go back and modify your previous code. This is totally normal!

When training make sure you're updating only the weights of the feed-forward network. You should be able to get the validation accuracy above 70% if you build everything right. Make sure to try different hyperparameters (learning rate, units in the classifier, epochs, etc) to find the best model. Save those hyperparameters to use as default values in the next part of the project.

Image Preprocessing
You'll want to use PIL to load the image (documentation). It's best to write a function that preprocesses the image so it can be used as input for the model. This function should process the images in the same manner used for training.

First, resize the images where the shortest side is 256 pixels, keeping the aspect ratio. This can be done with the thumbnail or resize methods. Then you'll need to crop out the center 224x224 portion of the image.

Color channels of images are typically encoded as integers 0-255, but the model expected floats 0-1. You'll need to convert the values. It's easiest with a Numpy array, which you can get from a PIL image like so np_image = np.array(pil_image).

As before, the network expects the images to be normalized in a specific way. For the means, it's [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and for the standard deviations [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. You'll want to subtract the means from each color channel, then divide by the standard deviation.

And finally, PyTorch expects the color channel to be the first dimension but it's the third dimension in the PIL image and Numpy array. You can reorder dimensions using ndarray.transpose. The color channel needs to be first and retain the order of the other two dimensions.


Class Prediction
Once you can get images in the correct format, it's time to write a function for making predictions with your model. A common practice is to predict the top 5 or so (usually called top-$K$) most probable classes. You'll want to calculate the class probabilities then find the $K$ largest values.

To get the top $K$ largest values in a tensor use x.topk(k). This method returns both the highest k probabilities and the indices of those probabilities corresponding to the classes. You need to convert from these indices to the actual class labels using class_to_idx which hopefully you added to the model or from an ImageFolder you used to load the data (see here). Make sure to invert the dictionary so you get a mapping from index to class as well.
